I'm a lecturer/research assistant professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University. Before joining Tsinghua, I was a postdoc research assistant in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University.

My research is based on deep learning, focusing on multimodal learning, large model theory & application, computer vision, data science, *etc*.
